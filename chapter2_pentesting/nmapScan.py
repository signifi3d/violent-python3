    Note:
        - There is an argument parsing error in the book that comes up
        several times where the author tries to parse a list of arguments
        delimited by ', ' however in optparse the assumed functionality
        doesn't exist and required various workarounds. Conveniently, 
        argparse does have such a functionality which is why the string 
        split has been removed. However, take note that the argument list
        in the command should only be delimited by a space and no commas.
